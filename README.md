## 📖 Overview

**Relax Coding Theme** is not just another color scheme; it is a productivity tool designed for endurance. Born from the philosophy that coding is a marathon, not a sprint, this theme suite prioritizes eye comfort and mental clarity over long hours of deep work.

We have meticulously eliminated harsh contrasts and pure whites/blacks to reduce eye strain, allowing you to focus on what matters most: your code.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👁️ Eye-Friendly Design
- **No Pure White/Black:** We use warm, paper-like off-whites (`#fffcf4`) and deep, warm grays (`#1a1812`) to mimic natural lighting and reduce blue light exposure.
- **Harmonious Palette:** A carefully curated selection of earth tones and calming accents (Teal, Warm Brown) creates a cohesive and non-distracting environment.

### ⏳ Perfect for Long Sessions
- **Reduced Glare:** Text contrast is optimized to be legible without being piercing, preventing fatigue during 8+ hour coding sessions.
- **Mental "Relax":** The warm color temperature creates a psychological sense of calm, helping you maintain a "flow state" without burnout.

### 🎨 Four Distinct Modes
1.  **Relax Coding Light:** The signature warm, paper-like experience. Perfect for well-lit environments.
2.  **Relax Coding Dark:** A cozy, deep-night atmosphere. Ideal for low-light settings.
3.  **Relax Coding Light High Contrast:** For those who need sharper definition while keeping the warm "Relax" background.
4.  **Relax Coding Dark High Contrast:** Maximum legibility with bright text on a warm dark background.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2.  Go to the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
3.  Search for `Relax Coding Theme`.
4.  Click **Install**.
5.  Go to **File > Preferences > Color Theme** and select one of the **Relax Coding** themes.
